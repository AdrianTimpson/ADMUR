Description: Statistical tools to directly model underlying population dynamics using date datasets (radiocarbon and other). Various model structures can be tested including Continuous Piecewise Linear (CPL) models, Uniform, Exponential, Gaussian, Cauchy, Sinusoidal, Logistic, Power law etc. Bayesian parameter estimates of population models. Taphonomic loss included optionally as a power function. Model comparison framework using BIC. 14C calibration. Generates Summed Probability Distributions (SPD) SPD simulation to test a null hypothesis. Goodness-of-fit tests. Archaeological phase date range estimation, including constraining by stratographic information.
