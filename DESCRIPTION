Description: Provides tools to directly model underlying population dynamics using date datasets (radiocarbon and other) with a Continuous Piecewise Linear (CPL) model framework, and model comparison framework using BIC. Package also calibrates 14C samples, generates Summed Probability Distributions (SPD), and performs SPD simulation analysis to generate a Goodness-of-fit test for the best selected model.
