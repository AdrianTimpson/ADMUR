Description: Statistical tools to directly model underlying population dynamics using date datasets (radiocarbon and other). Various model structures can be tested including Continuous Piecewise Linear (CPL) models that are flexible to estimate any complex population dynamics, Uniform, Exponential, Gaussian, Cauchy, Sinusoidal, Logistic and Power law. Bayesian parameter estimates of population models. Taphonomic loss included optionally as a power function. Model comparison framework using BIC. Package also calibrates 14C samples, generates Summed Probability Distributions (SPD), and performs SPD simulation analysis to generate a Goodness-of-fit test for the best selected model. Details about the method can be found in Timpson A., Barberena R., Thomas M. G., Mendez C., Manning K. (2020) <https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rstb.2019.0723>.
