Ancient Demographic Modelling Using Radiocarbon

This R package provides tools to directly model underlying population dynamics using date datasets (radiocarbon and other), using either a Continuous Piecewise Linear (CPL) model framework, or Summed Probability Distributions (SPD). SPD analysis can only reject or fail to reject any proposed population trajectory. In contrast, CPL modelling directly estimates the most likely population trajectory given a dataset.

This package IS DUE FOR COMPLETION END OF SEPT 2020, in order to accompany the publication of 'Directly modelling population dynamics in the South American Arid Diagonal using 14C dates' by Adrian Timpson, Ramiro Barberena, Mark G. Thomas, César Méndez and  Katie Manning. Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B 2020. https://doi.org/10.1098/rstb.2019.0723
