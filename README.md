# PopCPLmodel
Continuous Piece-wise linear (CPL) modelling of population dynamics using radiocarbon dates
R package provides tools to directly model population dynamics from radiocarbon dates. In contrast to Summed Probability Distribution (SPD) analysis of radiocarbon dates which can only reject or fail to reject any proposed population trajectory, this package directly finds the most likely population trajectory given a dataset.
This package accompanies 'Directly modelling population dynamics in the South American Arid Diagonal using 14C dates' by Adrian Timpson, Ramiro Barberena, Mark G. Thomas, César Méndez and  Katie Manning. Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B 2020.
